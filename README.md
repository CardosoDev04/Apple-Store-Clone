This project was my first attempt at a creating a website using the React 18 library.
It's a basic web page featuring:
- An animated Home page
- An animated store page with a product grid
- An animated about page


## Installation

Install the project:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the project
```bash
npm start
```

A window should open up at http://localhost:3000, if not please navigate to that URL.
